# Changelog - 2025-12-26 (#2)

## Slide Deck Architecture: Extracted Section Components & PageAsDeckWrapper

### Overview

This update introduces a modular slide deck architecture for the strategy and thesis narrative pages. Each section that was preceded by a badge and header has been extracted into its own reusable component. A new `PageAsDeckWrapper` layout provides double-click navigation between sections, making the pages function like a presentation deck while maintaining the flowing scroll experience.

Key deliverables:

- **17 Strategy Section Components**: Extracted from `strategy/to-carve.astro`
- **16 Thesis Section Components**: Extracted from `thesis/to-carve.astro`
- **PageAsDeckWrapper Layout**: Double-click and keyboard navigation between sections
- **Reassembled Test Pages**: Verify component composition at `/strategy/reassembled` and `/thesis/reassembled`

## PageAsDeckWrapper Layout

A new wrapper layout that enables presentation-style navigation while preserving smooth scrolling.

**Location:** `src/layouts/PageAsDeckWrapper.astro`

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Double-click Navigation** | Click in upper half → previous section; lower half → next section |
| **Keyboard Navigation** | Arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Home/End |
| **Section Indicator** | Current/total count displayed in bottom-right corner |
| **Navigation Hints** | Animated hints shown on page load (auto-hide after 3s) |
| **Scroll Snap** | CSS scroll-snap for clean section alignment |
| **Boundary Awareness** | Visual feedback when at first/last section |

### Props

```typescript
interface Props {
  enableScrollSnap?: boolean;     // Default: true
  showNavigationHints?: boolean;  // Default: true
  hintDuration?: number;          // Default: 3000 (ms), 0 = always show
}
```

### Usage

```astro
<PageAsDeckWrapper enableScrollSnap={true} showNavigationHints={true}>
  <SlideComponent1 />
  <SlideComponent2 />
  <SlideComponent3 />
</PageAsDeckWrapper>
```

The wrapper automatically detects `<section>` elements within the slotted content and enables navigation between them.

---

## Technical Implementation

### Vanilla JavaScript (Not TypeScript/TSX)

The navigation script uses pure vanilla JavaScript for maximum Astro compatibility:

```javascript
// Double-click handler
wrapper.addEventListener('dblclick', function(event) {
  var viewportHeight = window.innerHeight;
  var clickY = event.clientY;
  var isUpperHalf = clickY < viewportHeight / 2;

  if (isUpperHalf) {
    navigateToPrevious();
  } else {
    navigateToNext();
  }
});
```

**Key decision:** Avoided TypeScript class syntax and arrow functions in favor of vanilla JS function declarations for reliable Astro script handling.

### Reveal Animation System

Each section component uses the reveal animation system from the original pages:

```css
.reveal-item {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.8s ease, transform 0.8s ease;
  transition-delay: var(--delay, 0ms);
}

.reveal-item.revealed {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0) translateX(0) scale(1);
}
```

Animation types:
- `data-reveal="fade-up"` - Translate up 40px
- `data-reveal="slide-right"` - Translate from -60px
- `data-reveal="slide-left"` - Translate from +60px
- `data-reveal="scale-up"` - Scale from 0.85

### IntersectionObserver for Reveals

The reassembled pages include an IntersectionObserver script that triggers reveal animations:

```javascript
var observer = new IntersectionObserver(
  function(entries) {
    entries.forEach(function(entry) {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        var delay = parseInt(target.style.getPropertyValue('--delay') || '0', 10);
        setTimeout(function() {
          target.classList.add('revealed');
        }, delay);
      }
    });
  },
  { threshold: 0.15, rootMargin: '0px 0px -50px 0px' }
);
```

---

## Bug Fixes During Development

### Issue: Content Not Visible

**Symptom:** Scroll-snap worked but content was invisible.

**Root Cause:** The reveal animation script was looking for `.slide-deck .reveal-item` but the wrapper class was `.deck-wrapper`.

**Fix:** Updated selector to `.deck-wrapper .reveal-item` in both reassembled pages.

### Issue: TypeScript Syntax in Script Block

**Symptom:** Arrow functions and type assertions not processing correctly.

**Fix:** Converted all script code to vanilla JavaScript:

```javascript
// Before (TypeScript)
const delay = parseInt((entry.target as HTMLElement).style.getPropertyValue('--delay') || '0');

// After (Vanilla JS)
var target = entry.target;
var delay = parseInt(target.style.getPropertyValue('--delay') || '0', 10);
```

## Future Enhancements

The modular architecture enables several future possibilities:

1. **Custom Deck Compositions**: Mix and match sections from strategy and thesis
2. **Presentation Mode**: Full-screen with progress bar
3. **Export to PDF**: Server-side rendering of slides
4. **Slide Thumbnails**: Navigation via thumbnail strip
5. **Transition Effects**: Custom animations between sections

---

## Summary

This refactor transforms the monolithic `to-carve.astro` files into a composable slide system:

1. **33 Reusable Slide Components**: Each section is independently usable
2. **PageAsDeckWrapper**: Presentation-style navigation with scroll-snap
3. **Vanilla JS Only**: No TypeScript/TSX patterns in client scripts
4. **Preserved Animations**: All reveal animations work via IntersectionObserver

The slide components can now be imported individually for custom page compositions or reassembled in any order for different presentation contexts.
