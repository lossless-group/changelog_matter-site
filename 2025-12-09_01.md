# Changelog - 2025-12-09 (#1)

## Dark Matter Site: Team Page, Person Cards, and Social Icons

### Overview

Implemented the first version of the Dark Matter team page following the shared `TeamPagesSpecification.md` pattern, including:

- A data-driven team model (`TeamMember`) backed by JSON content.
- Role-based spans for **Managing Partners** and **Founding Team**.
- A simplified but theme-aware `PersonCard` component.
- New inline SVG social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, Medium, Substack, X) that inherit the surrounding text color.

This gives Dark Matter a reusable team presentation pattern aligned with Hypernova/TWF, but styled for the Matter theme.

---

## Changes by Area

### 1. Team Data Model & Content

- Added `src/types/team.ts`:
  - Defines `SocialLink`, `TeamMember`, `TeamSectionProps`, and a `TeamRole` union.
  - Mirrors the Hypernova/TWF shape so future sites can reuse utilities.
- Created `src/content/people/team.json` as the initial Dark Matter team source of truth:
  - Seeded entries for **Mark Moline**, **Skinner Layne**, **Michael Staton**, and **Thomas Vu**.
  - Included `classifiers` values such as `"Managing Partner, Team"` and `"Founding Partner, Team"` to drive role grouping.
  - Added social links (LinkedIn, X, GitHub, Medium) using a `{ name, href, icon }` structure compatible with `SocialIcons`.

### 2. Grouping Logic & /team Page

- Implemented `src/pages/team.astro`:
  - Imports `team.json` as `TeamMember[]`.
  - Implements a `groupByRole` helper that:
    - Normalizes `classifiers` to an array.
    - Uses a `classifierMap` to map values like `"Managing Partner"`, `"Founding Principal"`, and `"Founding Partner"` into internal buckets (`managingPartners`, `foundingTeam`).
    - Ensures each person appears in exactly one primary span on the page.
  - Computes `groupedTeamData` and passes the buckets into span components.
- Current spans rendered on `/team`:
  - `ManagingPartnersSpan` → Mark.
  - `FoundingTeamSpan` → Skinner, Michael, Thomas (all `Founding Partner`-classified profiles).

### 3. Layout & Spans

- Added `src/layouts/TeamLayout.astro`:
  - Wraps team content in `BaseThemeLayout`.
  - Provides a centered main container (`max-w-5xl`) with a responsive grid (`grid-cols-1` → `md:grid-cols-2`).
  - Sets sensible defaults for `<title>` / description (`Our Team | Dark Matter`).
- Added span components in `src/components/team/`:
  - `ManagingPartnersSpan.astro`
  - `FoundingTeamSpan.astro`
- Shared characteristics:
  - Import a common `team-spans.css` stylesheet.
  - Render a role header (`<h1 class="role-header">…</h1>`) and a `.person-cards` container of `PersonCard` instances.

### 4. Person Card UX & Height Fixes

- Created `src/components/team/PersonCard.astro`:
  - Displays:
    - Square image (lazy-loaded) with hover scale.
    - Name + role centered.
    - Truncated bio (word-based, with a line clamp) to keep cards compact.
    - Optional social icons row at the bottom.
  - Uses Matter theme tokens for background, border, and text colors.
- Fixed card height behavior to avoid “cards into the abyss”:
  - Removed `h-64` and `h-full` style constraints from the card body so height is driven by content rather than a fixed 16rem block.
  - Replaced `flex-1` + `mt-auto` layout with a simpler column stack so the social row sits snugly under the bio.
  - Result: all cards shrink-wrap more closely to their content while preserving consistent styling.

### 5. Shared Span Styles

- Added `src/styles/team-spans.css` tuned for Dark Matter:
  - `.team-span` uses full width and `break-inside: avoid` so role groups stay contiguous.
  - `.role-header` uses a gradient from `var(--color-accent)` to `var(--color-foreground)` with a left border and underline, matching the Matter theme.
  - `.person-cards` uses `display: contents` so the outer grid controls layout.

### 6. Social Icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, Medium, Substack, X)

- Added SVG assets under `public/icons/`:
  - `linkedin.svg`
  - `github.svg`
  - `instagram.svg`
  - `medium.svg`
  - `substack.svg`
- Updated `src/components/ui/SocialIcons.astro`:
  - Accepts `socialLinks: { name, href, icon? }[]` and an `iconSize` prop.
  - Normalizes the platform via `(link.icon || link.name).toLowerCase()`.
  - Renders inline SVG icons for:
    - `linkedin`
    - `github`
    - `instagram`
    - `medium`
    - `substack`
    - `x` / `twitter` (X logo path)
  - All icons use `currentColor` for both `fill` and `stroke` so they automatically inherit the link’s text color and theme hover states.
  - Maintains existing pill-style button chrome (border, subtle background, hover transitions).
- Updated `PersonCard.astro` `SocialPlatform` union to include `medium` and `x` so TypeScript recognises these platforms when mapping social links.

- `src/content/people/team.json` — initial Dark Matter team roster and metadata.
- `src/layouts/TeamLayout.astro` — team-specific layout wrapper reusing the Matter theme shell.
- `src/styles/team-spans.css` — shared span styles (role headers, container behavior) for the team page.
- `src/components/team/PersonCard.astro` — reusable team member card.

### Modified

- `src/components/ui/SocialIcons.astro` — now renders inline SVG icons for common platforms using `currentColor` and supports `x`/`twitter`.
- `src/components/team/PersonCard.astro` — updated layout to be content-height driven and expanded social platform support (`medium`, `x`).
- `src/pages/team.astro` — added `groupByRole` helper, wired spans, and mapped classifiers (`Managing Partner`, `Founding Partner`, `Founding Principal`, `Founding Team`) to internal buckets.

## Notes / Follow-Ups

- The current role taxonomy covers **Managing Partners** and **Founding Team**; additional spans (e.g., Advisory Board, Fellows) can be added later using the same pattern.
- Team content is still placeholder text; bios, roles, and images should be revised with real copy before launch.
- Once stabilized, the Dark Matter implementation can be used as a reference for extracting a shared `@knots/team-patterns` package.
