# Dark Matter Website — Release v0.2.1

**Release Date:** December 27, 2025
**Version:** 0.2.1
**Status:** Production-Ready

---

## What's New Since v0.2.0

### Summary of Changes

| Category | v0.2.0 | v0.2.1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Strategy Page | Monolithic single file | 17 modular slide components |
| Thesis Page | Monolithic single file | 16 modular slide components |
| Navigation | Standard scroll | Double-click + keyboard deck navigation |
| Citations | Inline text | Popover-based with source links |
| Page Structure | `/strategy`, `/thesis` | Same routes, now component-based |
| Archive | N/A | Previous versions at `/*/archive` |

### 2. PageAsDeckWrapper Layout

New wrapper layout enabling presentation-style navigation while preserving smooth scrolling.

**Location:** `src/layouts/PageAsDeckWrapper.astro`

| Feature | Description |

### 3. Citation System with Popovers

Inline source attribution using HTML popover elements.

```html
<sup>
  <a class="citation-link" popovertarget="cite-source">[1]</a>
</sup>
<div id="cite-source" popover class="citation-popover">
  <p class="citation-text">Source Name, "Title," Year</p>
  <a href="https://..." target="_blank">View Source</a>
</div>
```

**Benefits:**
- Non-intrusive inline citations
- Click to reveal full source details
- Direct links to original sources
- Accessible keyboard navigation

### 4. Production Page Promotion

| Route | Previous | Current |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `/strategy` | Monolithic page | Modular components via PageAsDeckWrapper |
| `/thesis` | Monolithic page | Modular components via PageAsDeckWrapper |
| `/strategy/archive` | N/A | Previous monolithic version preserved |
| `/thesis/archive` | N/A | Previous monolithic version preserved |

### 5. Flare Component Evolution

New Three.js visualization components for visual storytelling.

**New Components:**
- `AviciiTriangles` — Triangle family visualization (inspired by Avicii logo)
- `EventHorizon-Spectra` — Cosmic particle visualization (renamed from DNA-Figure8)
- `DNA-DoubleHelix` — Biological helix visualization
- `Orb` — Configurable orb with neck/stem

**Improvements:**
- Lazy loading to prevent WebGL context exhaustion
